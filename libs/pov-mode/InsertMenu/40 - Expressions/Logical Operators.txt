// As logical operators there are '&' and '|' standing for
// logical AND and OR.
// They return arithmetic value 0 for false or 1 for true.
// Note that A and B are not handled bitwise but logical.

#if (A & B)
  ... // do this only if both A and B are true
#end

#if (A | B)
  ... // do this if either A or B is true
#end
